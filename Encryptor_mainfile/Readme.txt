Used programming language: Python

Python implementation: CPython



This is the main script.

you just need a fully working python interpreter with pip installed and under pip you required PIL and Tkinter

and thats how you can run this script.

and sorry because i am not a good programmer you are wondering why i am telling this

because i forgot to comment the code. 

if you got any idea how we can develop this more effeciently or you want to add any new feature
